    - [Star Wars Survey](https://github.com/liudmylaru/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/08_star_wars_survey/star_wars_survey.ipynb)\
    Goals: use survey data to declare that “The Empire Strikes Back” is the best of the Star Wars movies.\
    Methods: clean and mmap yes/no, checkbox and rank columns, use mean() and sum() on columns to find highest-ranked and most seen movie, use binary segments (gender) to analize data

    - [Analyzing NYC High School Data](https://github.com/liudmylaru/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/07_nyc_high_school_data/nyc_high_schools.ipynb)\
    Goals: compare demographic factors such as race, income, and gender with SAT scores to determine whether the SAT is a fair test.\
    Methods: plot bar of the correlations, scatter plot, make a map by district. 

    - [Clean And Analyze Employee Exit Surveys](https://github.com/liudmylaru/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/06_%20clean_employee_exit_surveys/clean_exit_surveys.ipynb)\
    Goals: combine the results for surveys from employees in two depatments of institute to answer the qestions about reasons of resigning.\
    Methods: clean data with vectorized string methods, transform data with apply() and applymap(), drop missing or unnecessary values with fillna(), dropna(), and drop(), combine data with concat().

    - [Visualizing The Gender Gap In College Degrees](https://github.com/liudmylaru/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/05_visualize_gender_gap_in_degree/gender_gap.ipynb)\
    Goals: visualizing the gender gap across college degrees in STEM fields, which stands for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.\
    Methods: subplot grid layout, hide x-axis labels, set y-axis labels, add a horizontal line, export to a file.
    
    - [Visualizing Earnings Based On College Majors](https://github.com/liudmylaru/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/04_visualize_salaries_after_college/salaries_after_college.ipynb)\
    Goals: explore and analize dataset on the job outcomes of students who graduated from college using visualizations.\
    Methods: pandas, scatter plots, histograms, scatter matrix plot, bar plots.

    - [Exploring Ebay Car Sales Data](https://github.com/liudmylaru/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/03_clean_data_used_cars/used_cars.ipynb)\
    Goals: clean the data and analyze the included used car listings.\
    Methods: map column names, convert string columns to numeric, work with outliers, explore datetime data, handle incorrect years data, aggregate and combine data to explore.
    
    - [Exploring Hacker News Posts](https://github.com/liudmylaru/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/02_hacker_news/hacker_news.ipynb)\
    Goals: analyse "Ask" and "Show" posts from Hacker News site to determine which more popular and find out is there a better time to publish posts to get more reads.\
    Methods: manipulate strings, work with timedate datatype, use object-oriented concepts.
    
    - [App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets](https://github.com/liudmylaru/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/01_mobile_app_profiles/mob_apps.ipynb)\
    Goals: analyze data about approximately 10,000 Android apps from Google Play and approximately 7,000 iOS apps from the App Store to understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users.\
    Methods: clean data, select relevant to the goal data, work with frequency tables.
