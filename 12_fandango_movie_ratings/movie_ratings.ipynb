    "# Investigate Fandango Movie Ratings\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Is Fandango Still Inflating Ratings?\n",
    "\n",
    "In October 2015, a data journalist named Walt Hickey analyzed movie ratings data and found strong evidence to suggest that Fandango's rating system was biased and dishonest (Fandango is an online movie ratings aggregator). He published his analysis in this article ([link](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Hickey found that there's a significant discrepancy between the number of stars displayed to users and the actual rating, which he was able to find in the HTML of the page. He was able to find that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The actual rating was almost always rounded up to the nearest half-star. For instance, a 4.1 movie would be rounded off to 4.5 stars, not to 4 stars, as you may expect.\n",
    "* In the case of 8% of the ratings analyzed, the rounding up was done to the nearest whole star. For instance, a 4.5 rating would be rounded off to 5 stars.\n",
    "* For one movie rating, the rounding off was completely bizarre: from a rating of 4 in the HTML of the page to a displayed rating of 5 stars.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fandango's officials replied that the biased rounding off was caused by a bug in their system rather than being intentional, and they promised to fix the bug as soon as possible. Presumably, this has already happened, although we can't tell for sure since the actual rating value doesn't seem to be displayed anymore in the pages' HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's analyze more recent movie ratings data to determine whether there has been any change in Fandango's rating system after Hickey's analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understand the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the best ways to figure out whether there has been any change in Fandango's rating system after Hickey's analysis is to compare the system's characteristics previous and after the analysis. Here ready-made data for both these periods of time:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Walt Hickey made the data he analyzed publicly available on GitHub ([link](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/fandango)). Use the data he collected to analyze the characteristics of Fandango's rating system previous to his analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "* One of Dataquest's team members collected movie ratings data for movies released in 2016 and 2017. The data is publicly available on GitHub ([link](https://github.com/mircealex/Movie_ratings_2016_17)) and use it to analyze the rating system's characteristics after Hickey's analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "`fandango_score_comparison.csv` contains every film that has a Rotten Tomatoes rating, a RT User rating, a Metacritic score, a Metacritic User score, and IMDb score, and at least 30 fan reviews on Fandango. The data from Fandango was pulled on Aug. 24, 2015.\n",
    "\n",
    "`movie_ratings_16_17.csv` contains movie ratings data for 214 of the most popular movies (with a significant number of votes) released in 2016 and 2017. As of March 22, 2017, the ratings were up to date. "

The slight left shift of the 2016 distribution shows that ratings were slightly lower in 2016 compared to 2015. This suggests that there was a difference indeed between Fandango's ratings for popular movies in 2015 and Fandango's ratings for popular movies in 2016. The direction of the difference: the ratings in 2016 were slightly lower compared to 2015.\n",

    "While comparing the distributions with the help of the kernel density plots was a great start, need to analyze more granular information. Let's examine the frequency tables of the two distributions to analyze some numbers. Because the data sets have different numbers of movies, need to normalize the tables and show percentages instead."
